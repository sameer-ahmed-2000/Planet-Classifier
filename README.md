# Planet-Classifier

Why did you choose the particular algorithm?

After comparing to accuracy of all algorithms, Random Forest Classifier Algorithm is higher than others.


What are the different tuning methods used for the algorithm?

I've used Randomized SearchCV for tuning 


Did you consider any other choice of algorithm?why or why not?

No,As I said earlier I have not considered particular algorithm, I compared all algorithms and choose this algorithm


What is the accuracy?

Accuracy of my model is 90.7%


What are the different types of metrics that can be used to evaluate the model?

Confusion Matrix, F1 score.
I've used F1 score for the eveluation of the model
